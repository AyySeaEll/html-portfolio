<h3>Pokémon: The First Movie</h3>
<p>Giovanni, the leader of Team Rocket, had ambitious plans to take over the world, involving his latest experiment, 
    a powerful clone of Mew—Mewtwo. Mewtwo is very powerful, and also very smart—smart enough to not want to be 
    controlled by Giovanni. It escaped from the lab, and now Mewtwo begins to concoct its own scheme, clandestinely 
    inviting a number of Pokémon Trainers to the ultimate test. Of course, if it's an event for talented Trainers, 
    Ash Ketchum will be right in the front row! Ash's excitement turns to fear and anger when Mewtwo reveals its plan 
    for domination, creating powerful clones of all of the kids' Pokémon so it can even the "imbalance" between 
    Pokémon and their Trainers. Despite Ash's protests, Mewtwo refuses to believe that Pokémon and people can be 
    friends. But faced with the determination of a young Trainer and the love of his Pokémon, Mewtwo just might have 
    to reconsider, especially when pitted against the power of the mysterious Mew!</p>

<h3>Pokémon: The Movie 2000</h3>
<p>Ash and his friends are on their journey through the Orange Islands—but even this seemingly quiet chain of islands 
    dotted throughout the waters far south of Kanto has its own mysteries, adventures, and Legendary Pokémon! Lawrence 
    III certainly knows it, which is why he's now traveling to the different islands and capturing the three Legendary 
    birds—Moltres, Articuno, and Zapdos. But even with all their power, those three are merely a stepping stone to an 
    even greater prize: Lugia, the guardian of the sea! Of course, Ash is completely unaware of all this when he 
    arrives at his latest destination. The islanders have big plans for him, too, but nothing so sinister—they want 
    him to take part in a ceremony to gather three elemental balls from different islands. When the weather across the 
    world goes out of control, this task takes on a new importance, as the capture of the Legendary birds has thrown 
    the environment out of balance. With Lugia's help, can Ash be the "chosen one" that everyone turns to?</p>

<h3>Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew</h3>
<p>Hundreds of years ago, Camaron Palace and its people were saved by the noble sacrifice of Sir Aaron, an Aura Knight.
  From that day forward the people have always honored his deeds with an annual festival. Of course, Ash isn't really
  much of a history buff—he's more interested in the Pokémon competition being held! Only when he wins and is asked 
  to don the ceremonial role of Aura Guardian does Aaron's importance become clear—especially when Lucario emerges 
  from Aaron's staff! Aaron isn't a hero to this long-dormant Pokémon—all Lucario remembers is the master that betrayed 
  it! Left out of the battle all those hundreds of years before, Lucario is asked to be a hero again—Mew has shown up 
  and whisked Pikachu and Meowth away to the Tree of Life, and only Lucario can lead the way! Can Lucario put aside 
  its distrust of humans long enough to reunite Ash with his best friend?</p>
